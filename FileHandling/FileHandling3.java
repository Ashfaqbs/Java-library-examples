           // code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to

           // recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can

           // run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer

           // architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer

           // low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic

           // capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are

           // typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java
